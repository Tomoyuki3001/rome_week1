                <h2>People of Rome</h2>
                <p>Since ancient times, to be a citizen of Rome has been a source of pride. Today there is still considerable prestige in being a Romano di Roma, or “Roman” Roman. Among such Romans are the “black nobility,” families with papal titles who form a society within high society, shunning publicity and not given to great intimacy with the “white nobility,” whose titles were conferred by mere temporal rulers. The inhabitants who consider themselves the most nobly Roman of them all are the people of the Trastevere (“Across the Tiber”) district. In ancient times, Trastevere was the quarter for sailors and foreigners, whereas the founding fathers eastward across the river were soldiers and farmers. From the Middle Ages a number of palaces there were the homes of powerful families.</p>

                    <h2>Economy</h2>
                    <p>Rome cannot be called an industrial city, although it has a fair amount of medium and light industries. Among these have been the engineering, electronics, and chemical industries, as well as printing, clothing manufacture, and food processing. Factories have been located mostly in the northwestern part of the city, but many closed or relocated during the 1980s and 90s. The construction industry remains important.</p>

                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                <p>Traffic is a typical Roman dilemma because much of the municipal revenue is derived from the more than a million automobiles and motor scooters that render city life difficult. The average noise during waking hours is at or above the level that gradually induces deafness, whereas the average speed of motor traffic, in spite of the audacity and acuity of the drivers, is utterly slow. Beginning in 1973, both to reduce congestion and noise and air pollution, private vehicles were banned from parts of the city’s ancient section. Other attempts have been made to improve the traffic situation, particularly after the election of an environmentally minded mayor, Francesco Rutelli, in 1993. Nevertheless, the basic problems of traffic and parking remain central ones for the city and its province.</p>

                    <h2>Climate</h2>
                    <p>Romes hot, dry summer days, with high temperatures often above 75 °F (24 °C), are frequently cooled in the afternoons by the ponentino, a west wind that rises from the Tyrrhenian Sea. The city receives roughly 30 inches (750 mm) of precipitation annually; spring and autumn are the rainiest seasons. Frosts and occasional light snowfalls punctuate the otherwise mild winters, when high temperatures average just above 50 °F (10 °C). The tramontana, a cold, dry wind from the north, frequents the city in the winter.

                    <p>The powerful and ancient city of Rome has a rich, globally influenced past and is full of historically significant monuments. Founded sometime around 700 BC, this Italian city was once the heart of the powerful Roman Empire. Over the years, Rome has evolved into a cosmopolitan city known for its architecture, gourmet food, and stunning landscapes, which is probably why 4.2 million people choose to live in the citys entire urban area.</div>
